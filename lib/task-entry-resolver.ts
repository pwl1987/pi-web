/**
 * Map a todo taskId to the session entry that last mentioned it.
 *
 * Walks SessionEntry[] (from getSessionEntries) and returns the latest
 * entry whose `message` is a toolResult from the `todo` tool AND whose
 * `message.details.tasks` array contains an entry with the matching id.
 *
 * The function deliberately does not filter out "deleted" tombstones:
 * the latest reference wins, even if the most recent snapshot marked
 * the task as deleted. UI layers that hide deleted tasks should filter
 * at display time; this resolver stays pure and lets callers decide.
 *
 * Why "latest": rpiv-todo (and any reasonable todo tool) sends a full
 * snapshot on every update. So task 1 appears in the create entry,
 * the progress-update entry, the complete entry, and possibly a delete
 * entry. The one the user actually wants to scroll to is whichever
 * snapshot is closest in time to "now" for that taskId — i.e. the
 * latest one.
